# Marvel-Character-Quiz
---
This project is a web application in which a user can take a short personality quiz that generates a Marvel character they most resemble from 5 options, including Black Widow, Deadpool, Captain America, Groot, and Spiderman. We used get requests from both a Marvel API and a cocktail database API in order to show the matching character and a drink they'd theoretically enjoy as well. 

## User Story

```md
 As a Marvel fan, I want to take a personality quiz, so that I can be matched with a Marvel character I resemble the most.
```

## Webpage Overview
- Header: Displays a message to the user and the questions for the quiz.
- Main Content: Displays navigation button, quiz questions and answers, and the quiz results
- Colors: We used Marvel's white and red colors throughout the app to match the theme

## App Structure and Features
- Dynamic module and quiz Q&A: Both are created dynamically for standard business hours. Each element and styliing is added or updated to the main container using JavaScript.
